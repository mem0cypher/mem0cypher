Shipping open-source projects and prototypes managing agentic artificial intelligence. After years of learning and creating, I'm now utilizing Agentic AI to be better, faster and to learn even more. Currently either streaming or "managing agents" / vibe coding.

## Current Mood

**> "Currently setting up a workflow and instruture with my agents to make it so i push to git all the time almost everyday with my agents and automations with it being a good place for them to understand context and have a better context when working with my coding agnets and when they work together.
